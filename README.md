# DNN for GW Hyperarameter Estimation
Using Depp Learning method to estimate GW parameter space by training DNN with a GW template bank.

Trying to extend the job done in reference.

## Data Preparation
1. Generate pure LISA signals as templates(~ 3000) 
2. obtain real noise time series from LISA noise PSD(Power Spectral Density)
3. Whiten our data using LISA PSD before add multiple realizations of :
  1. White Gaussian Noise
  2. Real LISA Noise
4. Shift signal peak to left at some random time
5. Add multiple noise realizations to shifted(whitened(signal))

## DNN Design
We use, at first, the same DNN used in **Reference**.
